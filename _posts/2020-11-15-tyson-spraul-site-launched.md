Well. Finally got around to putting a personal website together. Besides refreshing myself on HTML and CSS, it's 
helping me get more comfortable with GitHub, where I decided to host the site, as I'm getting back into coding. 
It's generally been rather easy, but a few things have tripped me up and had to search around for examples and solutions. 
But hey, that's just learning.
