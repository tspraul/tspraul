Well. Finally got around to putting a personal website together. Besides refreshing myself on HTML and CSS, it's 
helping me get more comfortable with GitHub, where I decided to host the site, as I'm getting back into coding. 
It's generally been rather easy, but a few things have tripped me up and had to search around for examples and solutions. 
But hey, that's just learning.

I used http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/ as a guide to help get me off the ground, but this tip (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45945330/jekyll-git-hub-pages-no-styles-applied) appears to be necessary to get it all working nicely.
